<h1>CSS Helper Chrome Extension</h1>

<p>CSS Helper is a Chrome Extension that displays all relevant CSS Properties of the element currently being hovered over.</p>
<p>Presently, the extension shows a set of predefined CSS properties and their corresponding values for the hovered element. 
In the later versions, we will update the CSS Property Set to be specific and relevant to various HTML tags usually used in
websites.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone repository</li>
<li>Go to Settings on Google Chrome</li>
<li>Select Extensions from the left menu</li>
<li>Click on 'Load Unpacked Extension' and select the cloned repository</li>
<li>Select 'Enable'</li>
</ol>

<p>I will upload the Extension to the Chrome Web App Store soon.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Click on the 'Image Enlarger' Extension icon next to your address bar to enable the extension. Click again to disable. The extension will
toggle between clicks.</li>
<li>While enabled on Chrome, the mouse cursor will be followed continuously by a popup bubble that will display the CSS properties of 
the hovered element and its corresponding value.</li>
<li>Since jQuery usually detects the parent elements rather than the nested children, consider taking your cursor out of
the body of the tab and repointing it at the element if you detect incorrect values being displayed due to update failure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update</h2>
<p>CSS Helper now works for specific CSS elements and displays a set of properties and their correspoding values for that particular
hovered element.</p>

<h2>List of CSS Elements</h2>
<p>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, span, li, b, i, em, strong, blockquote, a, li

<h2>List of CSS Properties</h2>
<p>font-family, font-size, font-weight, font-style, color, letter-spacing, line-height, text-decoration</p>
